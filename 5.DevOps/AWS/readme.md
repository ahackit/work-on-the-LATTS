## Amazon Simple Storage Service - S3
- You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web.
- Amazon S3 stores data as objects within buckets. An object is a file and any optional metadata that describes the file. To store a file in Amazon S3, you upload it to a bucket. When you upload a file as an object, you can set permissions on the object and any metadata.
- Buckets are containers for objects. You can have one or more buckets. You can control access for each bucket, deciding who can create, delete, and list objects in it. You can also choose the geographical Region where Amazon S3 will store the bucket and its contents and view access logs for the bucket and its objects.

##  Elastic Compute Cloud - EC2
