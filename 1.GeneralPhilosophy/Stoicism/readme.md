- Always Test Your Impressions
- Focus on What You Control
- Take Responsibility
- Take Back Your Time: Prioritize and Make Time for What Matters
- Accept rather than Fight What Happens
- Act Despite the Emotions: Endure and Renounce
- Buy Tranquility Whenever Possible
- Don’t Complain and Take it as Training
- Eliminate the Nonessential
- Be Kind and Forgive the Wrongs of Others
- Listen and Say Only What Isn’t Better Left Unsaid
