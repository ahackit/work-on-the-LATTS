# Work on the LATTs

What's a LATT workout? I find myself focusing in on the specific problems I'm solving each day, which is fine and dandy because things are getting solved, but it's important to avoid the trap of just "solving the problem" and instead understand some of the fundamentals of the problem or the tools I am using/could be using. 

By adding to this living repo of notes that are comprised of my discoveries throughout the day, these LATTs are merely my continued attempt to educate myself and "Learn All The Things - LATTs" 

Something something something - t-shaped developer? or Pi-shaped developer?

I don't know. Just want to know how webpack works. It isn't a full body workout if your LATT's aren't getting action.
