# work-on-the-latts
Address book to all LATT workouts.

What's a LATT workout? I find myself focusing in on the specific tech stack I'm using to solve tasks, which is fine and dandy, but it's important to understand some the fundamentals, tools used to build that stack, and very closely-related tools that I could be utilizing. 

Something something something - t-shaped developer? or Pi-shaped developer? 

I don't know. Just want to know how webpack works.

It isn't a full body workout if your LATT's aren't getting action.
