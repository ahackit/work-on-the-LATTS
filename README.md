# work-on-the-latts

Address book to all LATT workouts.

What's a LATT workout? I find myself focusing in on the specific problems I'm solving each day , which is fine and dandy, but it's important to understand some the fundamentals, tools used to solve those problems, and understand very closely-related tools that I could be or am utilizing.

These LATTs are merely my attempt to learn all the things and create a working note sheet on all my discoveries. 

Something something something - t-shaped developer? or Pi-shaped developer?

I don't know. Just want to know how webpack works. It isn't a full body workout if your LATT's aren't getting action.

See below for all my living brain dumps. Currently updating them.
