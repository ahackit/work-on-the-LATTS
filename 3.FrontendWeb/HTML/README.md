## What is HTML?

The definition of HTML is HyperText Markup Language.

- HyperText is the method by which you move around on the web — by clicking on special text called hyperlinks which bring you to the next page. The fact that it is hyper just means it is not linear — i.e. you can go to any place on the Internet whenever you want by clicking on links — there is no set order to do things in.
- Markup is what HTML tags do to the text inside them. They mark it as a certain type of text (italicised text, for example).
- HTML is a Language, as it has code-words and syntax like any other language.

## How does it work?

- HTML consists of a series of tags saved as a html file.
- The browser requests an address from a Web server and it returns that HTML file
- This browser reads the file and translates the text into a visible form

## What are tags?
- The code for specific types of elements in HTML. Browsers by default know how to render basic versions of them
- Find a total list of tags and put here - Austin
 
## Semantic HTML
- Semantic elements mean elements with meaning. 
- Semantic elements help describe meaning to the browser and developer.
- Stop writing divs everywhere.
- Use these instead
  - article	Defines independent, self-contained content
  - aside	Defines content aside from the page content
  - details	Defines additional details that the user can view or hide
  - figcaption	Defines a caption for a figure element
  - figure	Specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
  - footer	Defines a footer for a document or section
  - header	Specifies a header for a document or section
  - main	Specifies the main content of a document
  - mark	Defines marked/highlighted text
  - nav	Defines navigation links
  - section	Defines a section in a document
  - summary	Defines a visible heading for a details element
  - time	Defines a date/time

## Form Validation
- Before you submit a form, you typically want to do validation.
- That validation has usually been done through JavaScript.
- HTML 5 gives a lot of nifty features to validate on the element itself now.
  - required: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can be submitted.
  - minlength and maxlength: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data (strings)
  - min and max: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types
  - type: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or some other specific preset type. 
  - pattern: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow.
